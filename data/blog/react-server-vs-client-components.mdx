React 18 and Next.js 13+ introduced a powerful concept: **Server Components** and **Client Components**. If you’ve ever wondered when to use which, or why your button stops working when moved to the server, this guide is for you 🧠

In this post, I’ll break down what these components are, their differences, when to use them, and how they improve performance. Whether you're building a SaaS, a personal blog, or an e-commerce app, this will level up your React game 🚀

## 🔍 What Are Server Components?

Server Components are rendered on the server. They never reach the client — which means they don’t include JavaScript in the browser. That’s a big performance win!

Use them when:

- You don’t need interactivity
- You want to fetch data directly on the server
- You want to reduce bundle size

Example:

```js
// app/page.js
export default async function HomePage() {
  const data = await getData();
  return <ArticleList data={data} />;
}
```

## ⚙️ What Are Client Components?

Client Components are interactive and rendered in the browser. Use them for anything dynamic like:

- Buttons
- Forms
- Event handlers

You declare them by adding `'use client'` at the top:

```js
"use client";

export default function LikeButton() {
  const [liked, setLiked] = useState(false);
  return (
    <button onClick={() => setLiked(!liked)}>{liked ? "❤️" : "🤍"}</button>
  );
}
```

## 🧠 When to Use Which?

| Use Case                     | Server Component | Client Component |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- |
| Static content               | ✅               | ❌               |
| Data fetching on server      | ✅               | ❌               |
| Interactivity (buttons etc.) | ❌               | ✅               |
| Forms or animations          | ❌               | ✅               |

## 🧪 Combining Both

You can combine both to create powerful apps. Nest a Client Component inside a Server Component:

```js
// Server Component
import LikeButton from "./LikeButton";

export default function Post({ post }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{post.title}</h1>
      <p>{post.content}</p>
      <LikeButton />
    </div>
  );
}
```

This way, your static content is lightweight, and dynamic features still work!

## 🪄 Next.js 13+ App Directory Magic

Next.js 13+ introduces the **App Router** that uses Server Components by default. You just drop files in `/app/` and you're using RSCs! Here’s what you get:

- Built-in layout system
- Suspense for async UI
- Automatic streaming

## 🧱 Best Practices

- Always start with Server Components. Add Client ones only when needed.
- Keep `'use client'` at the top!
- Avoid unnecessary interactivity
- Use Suspense to handle loading states

## 💡 Final Thoughts

Understanding the boundary between server and client is a **superpower**. It helps you build faster, smarter, and cleaner React apps.
